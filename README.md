# To-Do-List
Website that allows users to create to-do lists and check off items when they are completed. 

A website that allowed me to explore combining Javascript/Jquery with Flask to create responsive linethrough effects and recognize what has been selected for removal from an unordered list. Seems to work best in the Chrome browser. Simply click on or beside the text of the item you wish to indicate has been completed. Before refreshing or closing out the screen, click on the 'remove completed' button to see the list reordered with your items removed.
